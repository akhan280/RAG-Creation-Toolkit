# Data Directory

This directory is used for storing datasets related to the RAG application, including raw data, processed data, and synthetic datasets.

## raw/

- **Purpose**: Store raw data files that are directly collected or provided without any preprocessing. These files serve as the original data source and are used for generating synthetic datasets and for reference during data processing steps.

## processed/

- **Purpose**: Store processed data files that have undergone preprocessing steps such as cleaning, transformation, or normalization. These files are ready to be used for training and evaluation purposes within the RAG application.

## synthetic/

- **Purpose**: Store synthetic datasets generated using RAGAS. These datasets are created based on the raw data and are used for evaluating the RAG system's performance. Synthetic datasets are designed to mimic real-world data scenarios for robust testing and validation.
